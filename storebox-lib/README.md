### StoreBox Lib ###
The Java library module for StoreBox that can be used on JavaSE without Android.

StoreBox initially was designed for Android to improve SharedPreferences experience.
However API is so cool so I created this project implementation.

To use it requires to define your own key-value storage based on SQL, file serialization etc.
